* let C be the grid computed by lcs()
* let X and Y be sequences
* i and j specify a location within C that you want to look at when reading out
  the diff. (This makes more sense if you understand the LCS algorithm, but
  it's not important.) When you call this function initially, just pass
  i=len(X) and j=len(Y).
function print_diff(C, X, Y, i, j)
    if i > 0 and j > 0 and X[i-1] = Y[j-1]
        print_diff(C, X, Y, i-1, j-1)
        print "  " + X[i-1]
    else if j > 0 and (i = 0 or C[i,j-1] â‰¥ C[i-1,j])
        print_diff(C, X, Y, i, j-1)
        print "> " + Y[j-1]
    else if i > 0 and (j = 0 or C[i,j-1] < C[i-1,j])
        print_diff(C, X, Y, i-1, j)
        print "< " + X[i-1]
